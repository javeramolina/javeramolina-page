                            <p>I'm a passionate software developer who enjoys turning ideas into real, working solutions. I believe in clear communication, collaboration, and growing together — not just on a technical level, but as people with shared goals and curiosity.

I’m genuinely interested in business and how technology can help ideas grow. Lately, I’ve been creating content on YouTube to share what I learn, explore new tools, and connect with others who love building and learning too.

Whether it's code, conversation, or a new business idea — I'm always open to exchanging knowledge and creating something meaningful together.</p>

I enjoy solving real-world problems, working with people, and turning ideas into meaningful projects or businesses. I believe in using tech to make a difference.</p>
